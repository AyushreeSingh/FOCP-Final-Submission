This document serves as the final assessment submission for the module "Fundamentals of Computer Programming" (FOCP). The submission consists of a repository that is organized into three distinct folders: "Portfolio," "Project-chat," and "Project-f1." Each folder contains specific components of the work completed throughout the course.

The "Portfolio" folder is a comprehensive collection of all the weekly tasks that were assigned during our classes. These tasks reflect the learning and progress made each week, showcasing the step-by-step application of the concepts taught in the module.

The "Project-chat" folder includes a newly developed interactive system designed to assist prospective students. This system uses an online chat interface to answer questions, providing a user-friendly and accessible way to share information.

The "Project-f1" folder features a program created to analyze a file generated by the timing system. This program processes the data and displays a detailed breakdown of the current driversâ€™ performance, offering insights into their timings and achievements.

Overally, these folders provide a complete representation of the work undertaken for the module,
demonstrating both the breadth and depth of the learning outcomes achieved.
